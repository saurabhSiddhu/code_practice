## üìù Problem Description

Given an m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of grid[i][j] can be:
right. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j + 1])1 which means go to the cell to the 
2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j - 1])
o to the lower cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i + 1][j])3 which means g
(i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i - 1][j])4 which means go to the upper cell. 
that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.Notice 
ally start at the upper left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.You will initi
 least one valid path.Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at
