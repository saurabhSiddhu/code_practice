```

**A4:** What is the universal code template for solving "Find The Town Judge"?

```javascript
// Universal Problem-Solving Template for Find The Town Judge

function solveFindTheTownJudge(input) {
    // 1. Input validation and edge cases
    if (!input || input.length === 0) {
        return []; // or appropriate default
    }
    
    // 2. Initialize data structures (adapt based on needs)
    const result = [];
    const memo = new Map(); // for memoization if needed
    const visited = new Set(); // for tracking if needed
    const queue = []; // for BFS if needed
    const stack = []; // for DFS if needed
    
    // 3. Helper function (customize based on problem)
    function helper(params) {
        // Base case
        if (baseCondition) {
            return baseValue;
        }
        
        // Main logic - adapt to your pattern:
        // • DP: Check memo, compute, store result
        // • BFS: Process level by level with queue
        // • DFS: Explore depth-first with recursion/stack
        // • Two Pointers: Move pointers based on conditions
        // • Sliding Window: Expand/contract window
        // • Greedy: Make locally optimal choice
        
        return result;
    }
    
    // 4. Main algorithm
    // [Implement your specific algorithm here]
    
    // 5. Return result
    return result;
}

// Key Adaptations by Pattern:
// • Dynamic Programming: Use memo for caching
// • Graph Traversal: Use visited set + queue/stack
// • Two Pointers: Use left/right indices  
// • Sliding Window: Use start/end pointers
// • Divide & Conquer: Break into subproblems
