# Clone Graph - Interview Notes

## 🔧 Pattern/Category

Graph Traversal + Hash Map Mapping

## 🔑 Key Insight

**Handle cycles with mapping**: The core challenge isn't traversal - it's avoiding infinite loops in cyclic graphs by mapping original→clone relationships.

**Critical Realization**: You need to clone nodes on-demand during traversal while maintaining a mapping to handle cycles. Each original node maps to exactly one clone.

## 🧠 Intuition

**Natural Approach**: Visit every node and copy it, but this fails with cycles (infinite recursion).

**Optimized Insight**: Before creating a new clone, check if you've already cloned this node. Use hash map to store original→clone mapping. This breaks cycles naturally.

**Mental Model**: "Visit original, create clone if new, map the relationship, recurse on neighbors"

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- **Infinite recursion**: Not tracking which nodes you've already cloned leads to cycles
- **Multiple clones of same node**: Creating new clone every time instead of reusing existing one
- **Missing neighbor connections**: Forgetting to clone and connect neighbor relationships
- **Modifying original**: Accidentally changing the original graph structure
- **Null input handling**: Not handling empty graph or null input gracefully

## 📋 Template/Pattern

```javascript
// Graph Cloning with Mapping Pattern:
// 1. Create hash map for original→clone mapping
// 2. Start DFS/BFS from given node
// 3. For each node: check if already cloned, if not create new clone
// 4. Map original to clone immediately after creation
// 5. Recursively clone all neighbors and connect them
// 6. Return clone of starting node
```

## 🔄 Different Ways to Solve

1. **DFS with Hash Map**: Recursive traversal with original→clone mapping → O(V+E) time, O(V) space ⭐
2. **BFS with Hash Map**: Iterative level-order with queue and mapping → O(V+E) time, O(V) space
3. **DFS with Array (if numbered)**: Use array instead of map if nodes have small integer values → O(V+E) time, O(V) space

## 🌍 Real World Analogies

- **Photocopying Network Diagram**: Copy all nodes and connections while preserving relationships
- **Organization Chart Duplication**: Clone hierarchy while maintaining all reporting relationships
- **Social Network Backup**: Copy user network while preserving friend connections and avoiding duplicates

## 🔗 Similar Problems
